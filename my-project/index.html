        The Island of Hawai ªi is the largest U.S. Hawaiian Island, and it is the
        farthest south. It is also called the "Big Island." Its area is 4,038
        sq. miles (10,458 km2). The widest part of the island is 93 miles (150
        km) across. The Big Island has more than half (~62%) of the total land
        area of State of Hawaii. It is part of County of Hawaii.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="text-2xl">
        The island is seven separate shield volcanos that erupted more or less
        one at a time, one partly covering the other. These are (from oldest to
        youngest): Kohala (extinct), Mauna Kea (dormant), Hualalai (dormant),
        Mauna Loa (active), Kulani (extinct, mostly buried), and Kilauea (very
        active). The volcanos were caused by the Pacific oceanic tectonic plate
        moving over a hotspot. There lava from the Earth's lower mantle or upper
        core is close to the surface.

          Waikiki, with its beautiful stretch of oceanfront beach, is Hawaii's
          biggest tourist attraction. A suburb of Honolulu, Waikiki is popular
          for its big resorts, dining, entertainment, and shopping. The
          boardwalk, known as the Waikiki Beach Walk, is lined with cafes and
          entertainment venues, while Kuhio and KalaKaua Avenues are where the
          bulk of the area's restaurants and boutiques can be found.

          Pearl Harbor is a National Historic Landmark and active military base
          that earned its place in history for the 1941 attack, which killed
          1,177 servicemen on the USS Arizona. The site is now home to several
          attractions that are part of the World War II Valor in the Pacific
          Monument, including the USS Arizona Memorial, which floats above the
          remains of the sunken ship - parts of which can be seen protruding
          from the water. There is no cost for a tour of the memorial, however
          reservations are recommended due to its popularity.

          Ridiculously fresh, raw seafood marinated in the sauce of your
          choosing. The most popular variety is ahi poke, which is made with
          yellowfin tuna. If you're feeling adventurous, order the tako
          (octopus). A poke bowl (poke served on a bed of rice) makes for the
          perfect beach meal.

          There's nothing more comforting than a piping hot bowl of noodles
          after a long day of surfing. Saimin is Hawaii's version of classic
          Asian noodle dishes, taking elements of Japanese, Chinese and Filipino
          dishes to create a unique bowl of Hawaii. Saimin is basically the
          culinary representation of Hawaii as a crossroads for culture.
