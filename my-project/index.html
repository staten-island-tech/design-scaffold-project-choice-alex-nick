        The Island of Hawai ªi is the largest U.S. Hawaiian Island, and it is the
        farthest south. It is also called the "Big Island." Its area is 4,038
        sq. miles (10,458 km2). The widest part of the island is 93 miles (150
        km) across. The Big Island has more than half (~62%) of the total land
        area of State of Hawaii. It is part of County of Hawaii.

      <br />
      <p class="text-2xl">
        The island is seven separate shield volcanos that erupted more or less
        one at a time, one partly covering the other. These are (from oldest to
        youngest): Kohala (extinct), Mauna Kea (dormant), Hualalai (dormant),
        Mauna Loa (active), Kulani (extinct, mostly buried), and Kilauea (very
        active). The volcanos were caused by the Pacific oceanic tectonic plate
        moving over a hotspot. There lava from the Earth's lower mantle or upper
        core is close to the surface.

<header class=" bg-orange-400 rounded-xl">1.Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head State Monument</header>
<p class=" bg-orange-400 rounded-xl">Waikiki, with its beautiful stretch of oceanfront beach, is Hawaii's biggest tourist attraction. A suburb of Honolulu, Waikiki is popular for its big resorts, dining, entertainment, and shopping.
  The boardwalk, known as the Waikiki Beach Walk, is lined with cafes and entertainment venues, while Kuhio and KalaKaua Avenues are where the bulk of the area's restaurants and boutiques can be found.</p>

  <header class="bg-blue-400 rounded-xl">2.Pearl Harbor and USS Arizona Memorial</header>
<p class="bg-orange-400 rounded-xl">Pearl Harbor is a National Historic Landmark and active military base that earned its place in history for the 1941 attack, which killed 1,177 servicemen on the USS Arizona. The site is now home to several attractions that are part of the World War II Valor in the Pacific Monument, including the USS Arizona Memorial, which floats above the remains of the sunken ship - parts of which can be seen protruding from the water. There is no cost for a tour of the memorial, however reservations are recommended due to its popularity.</p>
