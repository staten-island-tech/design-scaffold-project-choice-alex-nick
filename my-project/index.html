        The Island of Hawaiʻi is the largest U.S. Hawaiian Island, and it is the
        farthest south. It is also called the "Big Island." Its area is 4,038
        sq. miles (10,458 km²). The widest part of the island is 93 miles (150
        km) across. The Big Island has more than half (~62%) of the total land
        area of State of Hawaii. It is part of County of Hawaii.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="text-2xl">
        The island is seven separate shield volcanos that erupted more or less
        one at a time, one partly covering the other. These are (from oldest to
        youngest): Kohala (extinct), Mauna Kea (dormant), Hualalai (dormant),
        Mauna Loa (active), Kulani (extinct, mostly buried), and Kilauea (very
        active). The volcanos were caused by the Pacific oceanic tectonic plate
        moving over a hotspot. There lava from the Earth's lower mantle or upper
        core is close to the surface.

          Pearl Harbor is a National Historic Landmark and active military base
          that earned its place in history for the 1941 attack, which killed
          1,177 servicemen on the USS Arizona. The site is now home to several
          attractions that are part of the World War II Valor in the Pacific
          Monument, including the USS Arizona Memorial, which floats above the
          remains of the sunken ship - parts of which can be seen protruding
          from the water. There is no cost for a tour of the memorial, however
          reservations are recommended due to its popularity.

      <p class="attraction-desc">Formed within the crater of a volcano on the island of Oahu, Hanauma Bay is a unique protected bay, which has been popular with snorkelers for a long time. After overuse caused pollution and damage to the delicate reef ecosystem, restoration efforts have restored the bay to its original splendor, and it is again open to visitors.
      
        The Hanauma Bay Education Center is a great place to learn about the bay, and there are several snorkeling rental shops that offer lessons, so that visitors can see the breathtaking reef system and its inhabitants up-close.

          perfect beach meal.

          There's nothing more comforting than a piping hot bowl of noodles
          after a long day of surfing. Saimin is Hawaii's version of classic
          Asian noodle dishes, taking elements of Japanese, Chinese and Filipino
          dishes to create a unique bowl of Hawaii. Saimin is basically the
          culinary representation of Hawaii as a crossroads for culture.
